2.The game begins with Player 1 rolling the dice.  
3.Each player takes turns rolling the dice and accumulating points.  
4.If a player rolls a 1, their turn ends, and they lose all the points accumulated during that turn. The other player then takes their turn.  
5.If a player rolls any other number, they can choose to roll again (and add to their turn score) or hold (and add their turn score to their total score).
